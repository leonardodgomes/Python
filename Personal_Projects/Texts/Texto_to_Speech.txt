Great speeches tend to withstand the test of time, offering immense wisdom and speaking directly to our souls long after their speakers have departed this Earth. There is no one official set of parameters that define a great speech. Some of the most famous speeches from history are extended affairs rich with language and story, while others are brief and spare as they only use words that drive home the message. Whether that is due to how well their author made an argument, how well images and ideas are fleshed out in words, or how masterly the language itself is composed, what historyâ€™s most famous speeches have in common is their undeniable impact.
